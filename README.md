Assignment for Object Oriented Programming class (course code CZ2002) - Create a application for restaurant staff to use. It should have the following functions:
- Create / Update / Delete customer reservations 
- Input orders for specific table
- Create a menu and promotional packages
- Keep track of revenue and types of dishes ordered
- Display which tables have been reserved so staff can easily assign a table to guests


We added an extra function that automatically manages reservations, such that if the reservation has expired, they will automatically be removed. The approach used to identify which tables were reserved based on the reservations was done quite well :D
